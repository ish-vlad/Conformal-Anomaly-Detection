# TODO

* Grid search implementation
* Find optimal hyperparams of kNN (only dimension and k)
* Implement CAD and apply it for score optimisation (direct application based on KNN hyperparams)
* Create running script, scoring and timing policy (+ processing)
* Move only calibration set
* Update notebooks

# Optional

* Matrix regularization
* Mahalanobis <-> weighted distance
